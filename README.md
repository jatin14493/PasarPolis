Interview Question


Write a function which takes an array of integers given as string as an argument and returns second max value from the input array. If there is no second max return -1.

 

let's take some examples:

 

1. For array ["3", "-2"] should return "-2"

2. For array ["5", "5", "4", "2"] should return "4"

3. For array ["4", "4", "4"] should return -1 (duplicates are not considered as the second max)

4. For [] (empty array) should return -1.

5. For ["-214748364801","-214748364802"] should return -214748364802.    

 

Restrictions :

1. CPU complexity should be O(n)

2. You are not allowed to change the array

3. Maximum length of the integer string can be 2^10=1024 digits 

 

Feel free to use the language of your choice.

 

Now this is a very simple problem. What we are trying to test if you can write code which is bug free and takes care of all the possible edge cases. So make sure that it is production ready
